    <p>Long ago, the ancient secret of masterfully brewed coffee was lost to the ages. Lost to time. Lost to entropy. 
        Lost to a trunk in a dusty basment most likely, but lost none the less! 
        Many thought the secret to the perfect cup would never be found. 
        That for all eternity coffee drinkers the world over would be forever bound to improperly dosed shots, bleached paper filters, mineralized water with improper PH balances and, 
        worst of all, Starbucks! <br><br> 
        But then one day, a our caffine savior appeared. 
        With bleached white jeans of a virgin and blowback hockey hair that screams out, 
        "ain't so bad, ehh?" the soon to be mythical figure known as Rowsdower lead his diciples through a metaphorically literal desert that was 21st century coffee culture. 
        It was upon his final resting place that he built it. The Mecca of Mocha. The Sistine of the Bean. 
        The one true cafe to rule them all.<br><br> Cafe Rowsdowers. The Final Cup.</p>
